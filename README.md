# Friend Finder

This application, Friend Finder, is a compatibility application to match the user with their "ideal match", sort of like Match.com (but not quite).

For this application, I have used Node and Express to handle the routing, and deployed it to Heroku for everyone to use.

In the application, the user fills out a form with their name and a ink to their photo, and then takes a quick 10 question survey. When they submit their answers, their total "score" is added, then compared to other users to find their overall "best match". In the end, their name and picture is displayed. Then, the user is prompted to try again (if they choose).


## Deployed via Heroku
If you would like to demo the application, the link is below.
